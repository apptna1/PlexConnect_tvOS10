# PlexConnectApp (working title)

Based on the experience with PlexConnect ([forum][], [github][]) this App was created as a proof-of-concept of an Apple TV 4 Plex client. And to have a look into Swift and the surrounding habitat...

It is based on PlexConnect's well-known XMLConverter concept, rethought and rewritten in Apple's Swift language.
